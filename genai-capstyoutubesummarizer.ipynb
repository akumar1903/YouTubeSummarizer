This notebook demonstrates a **GenAI-powered system** that can:\n-  **Summarize YouTube videos** using [gemini-1.5-flash-latest]\n-  **Ask questions** about the video using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**\n-  Store and retrieve content using **Chroma Vector DB** and **SentenceTransformer**\n\n---\n\n## Problem statement\n\n**Problem:** YouTube videos are rich in information, but it's time-consuming to extract insights or answer questions.\n\n**Goal:** Build an AI assistant that can:\n- Automatically summarize any video\n- Let users ask focused questions using retrieved context\n\n**GenAI Solution:** We use Google Gemini for summarization and Q&A, enhanced with embedding-based retrieval.\n\n---\n\n## GenAI Capabilities Used\n\n| Capability            | Description                                      |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Few-shot prompting   | Gemini is guided by examples for better output   |\n| Structured output    | Summaries returned in structured JSON format     |\n| Long context window  | Handles long video transcripts with chunking     |\n| RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | Retrieves relevant transcript context for Q&A |\n\n---\n\n## Notebook Guide\n\n1. **Setup & Installation** – Install libraries, configure Gemini, ChromaDB, SBERT\n2. **Transcript Extraction** – Fetch and process YouTube transcripts\n3. **Summarization (Gemini)** – Few-shot + chunked summaries in JSON\n4. **Embedding & Storage** – Use SBERT + Chroma to store transcripts\n5. **RAG Q&A** – Ask questions and get contextual answers using Gemini\n\n---\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Install Required Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Code
